This directory contains a sample VB 6.0 application that uses OO4O LOB features.
This sample is based on "mybook" table containing "chapters" CLOB column. 
The VB project includes MYBOOKPKG.cls generated by OO4O Code Wizard Add-in. This file can
also be generated using the OO4O Code Wizard command line utility as follows:
oo4ocodewiz scott/tiger@exampledb MYBOOKPKG

You must first follow the following quick instructions before the application
can be executed. 

1) Make sure that you have created the database alias 'exampledb' in TNSNAMES.ORA.

2) Log into the Oracle database and install the lob table and package stored in
   "lob.sql". lob.sql can be found in this directory.

4) Start the application. Enter Chapter number to display the chapter content.
