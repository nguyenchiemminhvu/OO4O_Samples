This directory contains a sample VB 6.0 application that uses oo4o VARRAY features.
This sample application creates collection object from VARRAY instance in the database.
This sample is based on "DEPARTMENT" table containing "ENAMELIST" VARRAY column. 
The VB project includes DEPTPKG.cls generated by OO4O Code Wizard Add-in. This file can
also be generated using the OO4O Code Wizard command line utility as follows:
oo4ocodewiz scott/tiger@exampledb DEPTPKG

You must first follow the following quick instructions before the application

   and DEPTPKG package stored in "varray.sql". varray.sql can be found in this directory.
