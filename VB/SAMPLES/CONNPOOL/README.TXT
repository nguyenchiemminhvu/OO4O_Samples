This directory contains a sample connection pooling application that uses oo4o.
You must first follow the following quick instructions to install
before the applications can be executed.

The server directory conains the ActiveX component written using oo4o.
The client application (in the client directory) then uses the component.
Note: Run connpool.exe before running client.exe
