This directory contains a sample VB application that uses oo4o 
and displays sales and order information.
This uses oracle datacontrol and the multiple cursor feature to 
display the information using minimal coding.

Before running the application, please run DEMOBLD7.SQL and 
MULTICUR.SQL in order to install necessary tables and plsql packages.
