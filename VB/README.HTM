<h4>This directory contains Visual Basic Samples that demonstrate OO4O features and the
support for new Oracle datatypes and features.</h4>

<p>They can be divided into the following functional areas</p>

<p><strong>Metadata</strong> - This directory contains a sample that can be used to
describe objects in the database.</p>

<p><strong>NestedTable</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that
uses oo4o Nested table features. This sample application creates dynaset object from
Nested table instance in the database. </p>

<p><strong>Objects </strong>- This directory contains a sample VB application that uses
Oracle's objects features. This sample application displays PERSON and ADDRESS object
instance from the database. This sample is based on CUSTOMERS table containing PERSON REF
column.Navigating rows in the CUSTOMER table displays corresponding PERSON and ADDRESS
object instance.</p>

<p><strong>Lob </strong>- This directory contains a sample application that uses OO4O LOB
features.</p>

<p><strong>OraNumber</strong> - This directory contains a sample that demonstrates the
functionality and precision of the new OraNumber object. Compare the precision possible
with this demo to the precision given by the Calculator tool that is included with NT.</p>

<p><strong>AQ</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that uses oo4o
and demonstrates advanced queueing features such as enqueueing and dequeueing of messages
of user-defined types.</p>

<p><strong>Varray</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that uses
oo4o VARRAY features. This sample application creates collection object from VARRAY
instance in the database.</p>

<p><strong>Failover</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that uses
the Failover Notification feature. You will need to configure an appropriate tns entry
that is setup for failover.</p>

<p><strong>Nonblock</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that
demonstrates executing commands using asynchronous processing.</p>

<p><strong>DBEvents</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB applicatoin that
demonstrates event notifications when subscribing to Oracle Database events.</p>

<p><a name="OO4O Automation features"><u>OO4O Automation features</u></a></p>

<p><strong>QT</strong> - This directory contains Visual Basic Quick Tour Guide</p>

<p><strong>ConnPool</strong> - This directory contains a sample connection pooling
application that uses oo4o.</p>

<p><strong>PLSQLCursor</strong> - This directory contains a sample VB application that
uses oo4o and displays sales and order information. This uses oracle datacontrol and the
multiple cursor (with PL/SQL REF cursors)&nbsp; feature to display the information using
minimal coding.</p>

<p><strong>Longraw</strong> - This directory contains a sample that demonstrates binary
data transfer between VB Byte array and Oracle LONG RAW column using AppendChunkByte and
GetChunkByte methods.</p>

<p><a name="OO4O DataControl features"><u>OO4O DataControl features</u></a></p>

<p><strong>Datactrl</strong> - This directory contains a simple form containing the Oracle
Data Control bound to a few commonly used bound controls. This form also demonstrates the
support programmatic interface from the Oracle Data Control (e.g. using the find method on
the datacontrol)</p>

<p><strong>Dept </strong>- This directory contains forms that demonstrate using the Oracle
Data Control</p>

<p><strong>Emp</strong> - This directory contains forms that demonstrate using the Oracle
Data Control</p>

<p><strong>Login</strong> - This directory contains a sample which can be used as a test
to see whether or not you can properly log into an Oracle Database.</p>

<p><strong>Lookup</strong> - This directory contains a sample that demonstrates how to use
lookups using Oracle Data Controls.</p>

<p><strong>Parm</strong> - This directory contains forms that demonstrate using the Oracle
Data Control and the OracleInProcServer. Using parameters means that the query will not be
reparsed.</p>

<p><strong>PLSQLCursor </strong>- See above in <a href="#OO4O Automation features"><u>OO4O
Automation features</u></a></p>
